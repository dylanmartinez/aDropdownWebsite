          This is one of the best artists in the area. Our customers flock to our location to see Dylan. He is professional and a great dude. The music is awesome and great for breweries and taphouses.

        What are your live performances like?

      <p>
        Overall, I can easily play <b>up to 4 hours</b> of covers and originals. Covers can include songs by The Beatles, Sublime, Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Police, Jazz Standards, Classic Rock, Acoustic Hip Hop, Dance Songs, and much more!
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for a more intimate, acoustic setting, then I can play <b>solo</b> for your guests to enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or I can play as a <b>trio band</b> (with bass and drums added) for a fuller, livlier set -- This ensemble is very flexible and works well in all kinds of spaces and venues.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll be sure to provide all of my own sound and lighting equipment, show up early (at least 30 min before showtime) to set up and sound check, and take a moment to meet the audience and pass out free stickers!
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, I'll invite family, friends, and promote the event online on eventbrite, bandsintown, reverbnation, travelsalem, instagram, facebook ads, and email.

          Your singing was, obviously, brilliant. Your cadence, pronunciation, pitch, runs and emotion were all present, in buckets. You also know how to write a chorus: It’s one thing to have a catchy, high energy chorus, but fitting some elegant, expressive lyrics into it is a beautiful thing indeed.

        Can you explain your style/music/history? (bio)
      </h2>
      <p>
        Dylan Santiago is a traveling, baritone-ukulele playing, singer/songwriter who grew up in the small city of Keizer, Oregon. When he moved to Orange County, he continued to study music, started performing at open mics, and soon began writing his own songs. During his travels across Europe and Asia, he would busk in the streets and play impromptu sets in local bars and cafes — which eventually lead to recording promotional videos, teaching workshops, and playing festivals. He is known for his unique playing style, powerful vocals, and expressive lyrics. His sound can be described as a cross between Jason Mraz/Jack Johnson/John Mayor.
